# User Story 

As a movie fanatic, I find myself searching through multiple resources to find information on movies. At times when I search a movie from a streaming service and they DO NOT have that movie on their platform, not only do I have to look at a new streaming service to watch the movie but I also tend to look for another resource to find information about the movie. Ideally, I would love to have one place that I can search for movies and get a snippet into the idea of what I'll be watching.
